#############################

This project was intended to replicate the classic minesweeper game
available at freeminesweeper.org in C. Rules for the game can be
found at https://freeminesweeper.org/how-to-play-minesweeper.php

All general gameplay is the same, with only a few minor changes:

  1) To flag an unrevealed tile that you believe is a mine,
     hover your cursor over that tile and press the 'F' key
     (rather than right click)
  2) There is no question mark feature as found in the optional
     settings at freeminesweeper.org

Enjoy
